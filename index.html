<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>1. AI Features & Explicit Consent</h3>
<p>AI features are optional and disabled by default.</p>
<p>When enabled:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your inputs (questions, prompts, selections) are sent to xAI’s Grok API for processing and generating responses.</li>
    <li>If Local Suggestions are enabled, approximate city-level or general location data (derived from device services) may be included in prompts to personalize outputs.</li>
    <li>No personally identifiable information (like name, email, or precise GPS) is collected or sent by the App itself. However, if you include any personal details in your prompts, they will be transmitted to xAI and may appear in generated outputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>No AI data is used to identify you personally.</p>
<p>xAI may use your prompts and inputs to improve their services, including model training and research (see xAI's full Privacy Policy at <a href="https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy">https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy</a> for details). We do not control xAI's data practices.</p>

<h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
<p>Depending on usage, we may collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>AI prompts (only when AI is enabled)</li>

</ul>
<p>Each provider operates under its own privacy policies.</p>
<p>xAI processes prompts under their own privacy policy (<a href="https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy">https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy</a>). Note that xAI may retain and use conversation data for service improvement, research, and model training. API usage is governed by separate terms from consumer access.</p>
